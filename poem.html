    <h1><b><u>Choice</u></b> </h1>
    <pre>
        learning chem, to get marks, not to make medicine out of it,
        but it's your choice |
        
        smart-watch on wrist, smart phone in hand,
        with a logo on it,
        not to show-off, to promote big corps
        but it's your choice |
        
        he went to class, he got a good grade & job,
        so he doesn't wanna waste his precious time 
        to solve issues out there
        but it's his choice |
        
        wrote an article on women's safety,
        printed it, distributed it,
        went home and abused her,
        but it's his/her choice |
        
        went to class, to learn math
        teacher was teaching,
        how to get marks,
        but it's his choice |
        
        looked at her, felt like I should talk to her,
        time went and so she,
        but it's her choice |
        
        thought of becoming lovable, for others,
        but soon got to know,
        I was just one-time usable,
        found myself in the bin,
        but it's their choice |
        
        saw rich people, living in a bungalow,
        thought they aren't conservative,
        but got to know they are cons-assertive
        but it's their choice |
        
        asked her, what is important money or passion,
        it wasn't sci-fi, she said money,
        don't judge her, that's what she taught by society,
        but it's her choice |
        
        past back in school, went to cs class,
        to touch that sacred computer, twice a year,
        indeed that was a privilege, that's my nation,
        school of central govt,
        wait,
        it's their choice |
        
        there is a pale blue dot, Carl said,
        where we all live,
        but some burnt cracker for every event,
        [30 years later], why you did this mom, I can't breathe
        
        [100 years later], why you did this, dad my son can't live without a ventilators
        
        lol, who cares, huh
        it's his choice |
        
        once a time, I fell in love with math and phy,
        but mentors ran away for a package-hy
        then I met someone who taught me, how wrong I was
        he told me you how to get marks..
        I fell on the corner of my mind, got crushed by the crowd
        when woke, were told I am not good enough,'
        indeed cause,
        it was their choice |
        
        when I was a kid, I remember, I wrote cartoon names on paper chits
        and gave to class, but she told her{principal}, she sued me,
        I become guilty, but I had no lawyer, why?
        fuhh,
        it's her choice |
        
        comes to the present, I don't like nostalgia-- okay
        but still one question is mine, why I got a punch in the face in my teens, while stopping others
        that's why now I ignore that word which always remained unanswered
        saw the imitation game, people love violence,
        but who are u and me,
        it's their choice |
        
        there was a funeral, everyone was grieving, one guy was laughing out loud
        they asked what's wrong, he said, that guy is dead he can't hear u,
        they got angry and hit him, he died laughing, but people still kept on crying,
        it was their choice |</pre>
